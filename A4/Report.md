# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

In this section we will look into a few of the Mutants reported by the PITest summary. For each Mutant we will show what has happenend provided in range code and explain why or why not the mutant has been killed.

### MUTANT #1.)

Info

Mutant 1 reported as KILLED

Mutant 1 effects the getCentralValue() method

Mutant 1 should be killed by our getCentralValue() test

Explanation

This mutant was killed by our unit test getCentralValue() seen above. This mutant changes the value of the 2.0 which divides the lower bound to 1.0. With this happening our test will now fail and thus kill the mutant as reported. Our test fails with this mutant as the value returned by exampleRange1.getCentralValue() will no longer be as expected 7.5. Instead since the exampleRange1 has range (5.0,10.0) the new calculation returned is (5.0/1.0) + (10.0/2.0) = 10.0. This does not match the previous expected value of 7.5 and is why the mutant is killed in this scenario.
