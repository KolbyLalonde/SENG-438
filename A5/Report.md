# Introduction

In this lab we will learn how to use reliability assessment tools to review integration test data. The two ways we will look into are 

  1. Reliability growth testing
  2. Reliability assessment using Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC)

Both of which will be studied in this project.

### Explanation of the decided MTTFmin value

After the intial setting up of test data was input into our RDC we had to modifiy to a couple parameters inorder to obtain a useful RDC. First we explored how changing the maximum number of acceptable failures variable would affect our chart. It was discovered that increasing this variable would push our data to the left cause for likely rejection. The other variable we changed was the number of input events. We found that the larger this was the more the data points would move to the right into the acceptable region. Our method for finding a useful MTTFmin was to get a ratio which would keep our data in the middle yellow region for the majority of the intervals. This is because it would provide a more accurate review of the reliability of the system. 

We ultimately spent a fair amount of time testing this ratio by increasing the max acceptable number of failures by 10 each time and the input events by 50 each time. We discovered that when the max acceptable number of failures was 100 and the input events was 5000 we had the best results. Therefore we preformed our MTTFmin calculation as follows. 

MTTFmin = (Max Acceptable Failures / Input Events) = (100/5000) = 0.02

our calculations for the other two RDC charts seen above where as follows

DoubleMTTFmin = (Max Acceptable Failures / Input Events) = (150/3750) = 0.04

HalfMTTFmin = (Max Acceptable Failures / Input Events) = (60/6000) = 0.04
