# 1 Introduction

In this lab we where given the task of creating unit tests for different methods of the org.jfree.data.Range and org.jfree.data.DataUtilities in the  package org.jfree.data. We will complete this using eclipse IDE and Junit. Our learning objectives for this lab are as follows:

1.) Create automated test code using JUnit and other XUnit testing frameworks such as NUnit.

2.) Incorporate and work with mock objects in test code development.

This lab will be an oppurtunity to develop our understanding of debbugging code through unit tests. We also will learn valuable skills in teamwork and planning to successfully complete this lab.


# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed

# 3 Test cases developed

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

To divide the workload of this lab fairly we where given 10 methods to test with 5 from .DataUtilities and 5 from .Range. We decided it would be fair to have two group members handle two methods and two group members handle three methods. The group members tasked with only two methods would be responsible for picking up the extra work by collaborating to write the lab report. The inital divison of work was as follows:

org.jfree.data.Range

Kolby - Two methods tested (combine and contains) + writing report .md
Siddharth - Three methods tested (getLowerBound, getUpperBound and getLength)

org.jfree.data.DataUtilities

Nolan - Two methods tested (createNumberArray and createNumberArray2D) + writing report .md
Sadman - Three methods tested (calculateColumnTotal, calculateRowTotal and getCumulativePercentages)

An agreement was made and expectation was all group members would be willing to provide feedback/guidance to others in cases of confusion. In the end all group members collborated and worked equally on this lab. Each member had a chance to walkthrough all 10 methods tested afterwards to gain a proper understanding of all learning objectives presented.
