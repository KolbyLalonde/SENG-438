# 1 Introduction

In this lab we where tasked with determining the adequacy of a white-box test suite based on its coverage of the code. We have been given the task of once again testin the Range and DataUtilies class as in assignment #2. The learning objectives for this lab were as follows:

To use code coverage tools to measure test adequacy and become aware of similar tools for other programming environments
To design test cases to improve code coverage
To understand some of the benefits and drawbacks of measuring test adequacy with code coverage tools
To gain an understanding of how data-flow coverage works and be able to calculate it by hand

Upon completion of the lab we will learn new skills in testing code through a white-box approach.
