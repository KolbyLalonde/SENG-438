# 1 Introduction

In this lab we where tasked with determining the adequacy of a white-box test suite based on its coverage of the code. We have been given the task of once again testin the Range and DataUtilies class as in assignment #2. The learning objectives for this lab were as follows:

- To use code coverage tools to measure test adequacy and become aware of similar tools for other programming environments.

- To design test cases to improve code coverage.

- To understand some of the benefits and drawbacks of measuring test adequacy with code coverage tools.

- To gain an understanding of how data-flow coverage works and be able to calculate it by hand.

Upon completion of the lab we will learn new skills in testing code through a white-box approach.

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

In our report we primarily used the coverage tool EclEmma as it was the suggested tool and worked the best for everyone in the group. We found the coverage tool EclEmma to be easiest to naviagate and plug in with the eclipse IDE. We had no crashes and found the overall user preformace to be the best. A slight disadvantage of the EclEmma tool was its inability to use the condition coverage. Due to this we had to use the method coverage as suggested in the lab handout. Other coverage tools we played around with were not used in the completion of the project as the group found EclEmma suffiecent. We wanted to keep everything clear as easy to navigate for all group members and TA marking. However we did find that some of the other tools have some negatives when integrated into the eclipse IDE. Some group memebers report diffuclties downloading a running coverage tools outside of EclEmma. So for these reasons other coverage tools were not explored to the extend of EclEmma. However a pro of some of the other tools would be their ability to provide more coverage options.
